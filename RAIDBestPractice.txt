depends on the database, depends on the part of the database.  Depends also on who you 
ask ;)

Here is what I like (raid 0 = stripes, raid 1 = mirrors, raid 5 = striping+parity):

o no raid, raid 0 or raid 0+1 for online redo logs AND control files.  You should 
still let us multiplex them ourselves even if you mirror them.  We have more 
opportunities for failure if the raid subsystem reports a "warning" back to us -- if we 
have multiplexed them -- we are OK with that.


o no raid or raid 0 for temporary datafiles (used with temporary tablespaces).  
no raid/raid 0 is sufficient.  If you lose these, who cares?  You want speed on these, 
not reliability.  If a disk fails, drop and recreate temp elsewhere.

o no raid, raid 0 or raid 0+1 for archive.  Again, let us multiplex if you use no 
raid or raid 0, let the OS do it (different from online redo log here) if you use 0+1.

o raid 0+1 for rollback.  It get written to lots.  It is important to have protected. 
 We cannot multiplex them so let the OS do it.  Use this for datafiles you believe will 
be HEAVILY written.  Bear in mind, we buffer writes to datafiles, they happen in the 
background so the poor write performance of raid 5 is usually OK except for the heavily 
written files (such as rollback).

o raid 5 (unless you can do raid 0+1 for all of course) for datafiles that experience 
what you determine to be "medium" or "moderate" write activity.  Since this happens in 
the background typcially (not with direct path loads and such) -- raid 5 can typically be 
safely used with these.  As these files represent the BULK of your database and the above 
represent the smaller part -- you achieve most of the cost saving without impacting 
performance too much.
