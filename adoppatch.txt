[applmgr@sniperhost app]$ . ./EBSapps.env run

Download patch to directory, represented by $PATCH_TOP variable and uncompress it here.
Next step - start patching cycle according to note 1355068.1 and Oracle E-Business Suite Maintenance Guide. adop will ask you for required passwords.

[applmgr@sniperhost app]$ adop phase=prepare
Enter the APPS password:
Enter the SYSTEM password:
Enter the WLSADMIN password:

Now move on with next phases. Make sure that adop always finishes with status 0. For particular actions for each phase refer to the Oracle E-Business Suite Maintenance Guide.

[applmgr@sniperhost app]$ adop phase=apply patches=19499499
[applmgr@sniperhost ~]$ adop phase=finalize
[applmgr@sniperhost ~]$ adop phase=cutover
[applmgr@sniperhost ~]$ adop phase=cleanup

Always check adop logfiles for any errors. Even if adop completes successfully, there may be some hidden warnings. I prefer to use this egrep pattern, catching most common errors:

cd $NE_BASE/EBSapps/log/adop/6
egrep -i "error|fail|ora-|ac-|rc-" ./*

Verify that patch was successfully applied using query from step 1. It should return output similar to this:
