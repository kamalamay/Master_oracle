How to compile Oracle Apps 11i Forms
============================
Check whether the forms that you want to generate are not in use at the time you are generating them.
 If they are in use when you generate the fmx files, the forms client session terminates.
1) Login to the Forms server node as applmgr and run .env file to set the applications environment.
2) Change directory to $AU_TOP/forms/US.
3) Use the “f60gen” command to generate the fmx files for the fmb files.
4) Issue the following command
$ f60gen module=<formname>.fmb userid=apps/<apps_pwd> output_file=/forms/US/<formname>.fmx

How to compile Oracle Apps R12 Forms
=============================
1) Log into the forms tier.
2) Set the applications environment
3) Ensure that the $FORMS_PATH includes $AU_TOP/resource and $AU_TOP/resource/stub, for example
echo $FORMS_PATH
/u01/oracle/DEV/apps/apps_st/appl/au/12.0.0/resource:
/u01/oracle/DEV/apps/apps_st/appl/au/12.0.0/resource/stub
4) Compile the form
a)- If you are using forms customizations (CUily: verdana,geneva;">1) Log into the forms tier.
2) Set the applications environment
3) Ensure that the $FORMS_PATH includes $AU_TOP/resource and $AU_TOP/resource/stub, for example
echo $FORMS_PATH
/u01/oracle/DEV/apps/apps_st/appl/au/12.0.0/resource:
/u01/oracle/DEV/apps/apps_st/appl/au/12.0.0/resource/stub
4) Compile the form
a)- If you are using forms customizations (CUSTOM.pll) then run the command below to compile the form.
frmcmp_batch.sh module=<path to fmb file> userid=APPS/APPS output_file=
<full path to fmx output file> module_type=form compile_all=special
For eg:-
frmcmp_batch.sh module=/u01/oracle/TEST/apps/apps_st/appl/au/12.0.0/forms/US/
XXX.fmb userid=APPS/APPS output_file=/u01/oracle/TEST/apps/apps_st/appl/inv/
12.0.0/forms/US/XXX.fmx module_type=form compile_all=special
b) If you are NOT using forms customizations, then run the command below to compile the form.
frmcmp_batch.sh module=<path to fmb file> userid=APPS/APPS output_file=
<full path to fmx output file> module_type=form
For example..
frmcmp_batch.sh module=/u01/oracle/TEST/apps/apps_st/appl/au/12.0.0/forms/US/
XXX.fmb userid=APPS/APPS  output_file=/u01/oracle/TEST/apps/apps_st/appl/inv/
12.0.0/forms/US/XXX.fmx module_type=form


How to Generate a Specific Schema Form through AD utility adadmin:
=================================================


1. Start the adadmin Utility
bash-3.00$ adadmin
Note:-From a command line session, as the applmgr user, start the adadmin utility.
Please note that if your system is configured using more than one tier and more than one APPL_TOP (in contrast to the shared APPL_TOP), you should run this utility from each forms tier.

2. Step Through the Initial adadmin Questions
Your default directory is '/oracle/prod/apps/apps_st/appl'.
Is this the correct APPL_TOP [Yes] ?
Note:-If the above is true, then hit the [Enter] key.
AD Administration records your AD Administration session in a text file
you specify.  Enter your AD Administration log file name or press [Return]
to accept the default file name shown in brackets.
Filename [adadmin.log] : POXBWVRP.log
Note:-Here you can record your adadmin session in a specific log file like above.
************* Start of AD Administration session *************
AD Administration version: 12.0.0
AD Administration started at: Tue May 07 2013 21:01:17
APPL_TOP is set to /oracle/prod/apps/apps_st/appl
You can be notified by email if a failure occurs.
Do you wish to activate this feature [No] ?
Note:-This option only works in UNIX and the purpose of this question is to notify the AD administrator by mail if any failure occurred while adadmin was running in unattended mode.
Please enter the batchsize [1000] :
Note:-This option asks for a specific batch size, to reserve memory when adadmin validates package and procedure information. This option only is meaningful when running database administrative related tasks. For the purpose of generating a form, you can leave the default value.
You are about to use or modify Oracle Applications product tables
in your ORACLE database 'ancprod'
using ORACLE executables in '/oracle/prod/apps/tech_st/10.1.2'.
Is this the correct database [Yes] ?
Note:-If correct, hit the [Enter] key. Otherwise, exit this utility by typing "abort" plus the [b] key and verify if your environment has been sourced correctly.
AD Administration needs the password for your 'SYSTEM' ORACLE schema
in order to determine your installation configuration.
Enter the password for your 'SYSTEM' ORACLE schema:
Note:-Here you must enter your SYSTEM database user password.
The ORACLE username specified below for Application Object Library
uniquely identifies your existing product group: APPLSYS
Enter the ORACLE password of Application Object Library [APPS] :
Note:-Here you must enter your SYSTEM database user password.
After finally reaching this point, the utility will try to connect to your database and get information regarding your system.

3. The next step which requires user interaction is the main menu:
            AD Administration Main Menu
   --------------------------------------------------
   1.    Generate Applications Files menu
   2.    Maintain Applications Files menu
   3.    Compile/Reload Applications Database Entities menu
   4.    Maintain Applications Database Entities menu
   5.    Change Maintenance Mode
   6.    Exit AD Administration

Enter your choice [6] : 1

         Generate Applications Files
   ----------------------------------------
   1.    Generate message files
   2.    Generate form files
   3.    Generate report files
   4.    Generate product JAR files
   5.    Return to Main Menu

Enter your choice [5] : 2

AD utilities can support a maximum of 999 workers. Your
current database configuration supports a maximum of 276 workers.
Oracle recommends that you use between 64 and 128 workers.
Enter the number of workers [64] : 8
Note:-In order to determine the optimal number of workers for your system, you should consider the following general rule:
Total of available workers for your system = (Number of processors) x 3
Your current character set is "UTF8".
Do you want to generate Oracle Forms objects
using this character set [Yes] ?
Note:-If this is your correct character set, hit [Enter].  Otherwise, please verify your environment.
Do you want to regenerate Oracle Forms PL/SQL library files [Yes] ?
Note:-In this case, we will generate PL/SQL library files, so you might reply 'y' to the above question.
Do you want to regenerate Oracle Forms menu files [Yes] ?
Note:-Same as above; reply 'y' to this question.
Do you want to regenerate Oracle Forms executable files [Yes] ?
Note:-Here, hit [Enter] to accept the default 'Yes'
Enter list of products ('all' for all products) [all] : PO
Note:-Now, we need to specify the Application short name. (po for Purchasing Order, gl, for General Ledger, ap for Payables, and so on).  In our example we will be using module fnd (Application Object Library).
In 11i, the entry must be typed using lowercase characters.
Generate specific forms objects for each selected product [No] ? Yes
Note:-Answer 'y' to this question, since it will regenerate all forms for the module selected previously if 'No' is answered here.
The current set of installed languages is: US
Please select languages for generating Oracle Forms files.
You may select all of the above languages, or just a subset.
Enter list of languages ('all' for all of the above) [all] :
Note:-In this case, reply 'all', since this will regenerate the form for all existing languages.
You selected the following languages: US
Is this the correct set of languages [Yes] ?

Enter forms to generate, or enter 'all' [all] : POXBWVRP.fmx
Note:-Enter ‘POXBWVRP.fmx’ at the prompt. Once you do so, adadmin will invoke the appropriate forms compiler and will regenerate the forms.
Generating Oracle Forms objects...
Note:-If any error is found, review the adadmin log file and the adworker log file(s).  The adworker log files are also located under $APPL_TOP/admin/<INSTANCE_NAME>/log directory.  The file name is adworkxx.log where xx is the number of the worker that had failed.
If submitting the problem to Oracle Support as a service request, please upload the adadmin log and the relevant adworker log.
